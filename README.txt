Zacaria Wilson Portfolio Website Code

This project and the code within it is not for public use at this time. Please do not use it.

Description:

My site is built in Webflow, which until recently only allowed for 10,000 characters of custom code per page (now 50,000). I needed to add a custom slider and ran into the limit while experimenting. So now I'm hosting my Javascript script here and using the JSDeliver CDN to add it to the page.
