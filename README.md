### Description:

This repo contains resources for my portfolio site, mostly custom JavaScript and CSS. 
The site is built with [Webflow](https://github.com/webflow), and the code is implemented using on-page [JSDelivr](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr) links, inserted with Webflow's custom header/body code features. 

### Project Structure

The resources for a particular page can be found under /pages/page-name/, where "page-name" is the slug of the page URL (e.g. pages/projects/ contains code for the page at zacariawilson.com/projects). Site-wide (on every page) resources can be found under /global/.
